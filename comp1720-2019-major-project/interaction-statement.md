Write your interaction statement in this file (max 500 words).
1. 
The first scene is inside a room. Viewer can click “START MY BLIND TRIP” to start their blind trip. Once user click it, the background will all become dark, and they can only see the light from window and the door handle. When the door handle is clicked, the door will open, and viewer can see stairs outside the door, and know they can click it to go outside. 
2. 
In the second view, they can see the shaking stairs and footprint, and “can’t see stairs clearly”. The cursor will become a pair of shoes, and viewers will understand to place it on the footprint precisely to go downstairs. If it is not placed precisely and clicked, viewer will hear the sound of “ouch” and tumbling downstairs. If all three steps are clicked successfully, viewer can see “Safe”. When they click the “go to street” arrow, it will change to the third scene. 
3. 
In the third scene, viewers can see buildings and hear the noises on the street. The text on the sign is not clear, with colour and size changing fast, so viewer will feel very hard to read it. There is text “I want go to the sea”, so viewer will know they need to choose the direction to the sea. The left sign is actually “MOUNT St”, and if user click it, it will change to the fourth scene, the wrong way, and they can go back the third scene by clicking “Go back” arrow. If they click the right sign, which is actually “LAKE St”, then they can go to the fifth scene.
4. 
In the fifth scene, the background will become dark. The cursor will become a walking stick. If user click the mouse, they can hear the sound of walking stick hitting the ground. If click at the left or right part of the screen, a red circle will appear, so viewer will know they cannot walk to this direction. If it is clicked at the middle part of the screen, a white circle will appear, and viewer can hear the sound of walking. After clicking three times, it will move to the sixth scene. 
5. 
In the sixth scene, viewer will see the crossing, and hear cars driving on the street. Viewer is instructed to ask for help by clicking “ask”, and there will be a voice of “anyone can help me”, but no response. Until asking four times, there will be a voice of “yep”, and then viewer can feel they are crossing the street. 
6. 
In the seventh scene, viewer finishes crossing street, and say “thank you”. Now they can hear the sound of sea, and the sound gradually becomes louder. Seconds later, it changes to the last scene, with text ”open my eyes”. When the cursor is placed on the eye, it will open, so viewer will know to click it. After clicking it, the night view of sea will gradually appear, and that is the end of this blind trip.
